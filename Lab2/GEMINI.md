# Directory Overview

This directory contains the materials for Lab 2 of the Data Structures course for the Fall 2025 semester. The main purpose is to store the lab assignment description and related work.

# Key Files

*   **`Lab2-1.md`**: This is the primary document for the lab. It contains:
    *   Detailed submission instructions, including the deadline (October 6, 2025), naming conventions, and submission platforms (elearning and Luogu).
    *   Three programming problems:
        1.  **Next Greater Element**: Find the next larger element in a circular array.
        2.  **String Decoding**: Decode a string based on a repetition rule like `k[encoded_string]`.
